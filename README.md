Diwali Sales Analysis

In this data analysis project,I leveraged the power of three essential Python libraries - Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn,to gain insight from the database and create compelling . This project demonstrates the value of data exploration and visualization in uncovering meaningful patterns and trends. 

Key components:
Pandas:
Pandas a powerful data manipulation library palyed a central role in this project. 
Pandas enabled me to efficiently load,clean and preprocess the dataset. 
I used pandas for data wrangling tasks, including filtering, grouping and aggregation data to prepare it for analysis.

Matplotlib:
Matplotlib,the foundational library for creating static, animated and interactive visualization in Python allowed me to generate a variety of plots and charts. 
I employed Matplotlib to create a bar chart , line plot, scatter plot and histograms to visually represent patterns and relationship within the data. 

Seaborn:
Seaborn,built on top of Matplotlib, enhanced the aesthetics and ease of creating informative and statistical graphics.I utilized seaborn's functions for creating heatmap, pairs plots and distribution plots to reveal further insights. 

Project Highlights:
Loaded and cleaned a real world dataset, handling missing values and outliers. Pandas for data aggregation and summary statistics to understand the dataset's characteristic. 
Generated a series of informative visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to convey key finding. 
Explored relationship between variables, identified trends and outliers. Created compelling visualization to present the result effectively.
